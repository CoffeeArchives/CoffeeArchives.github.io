<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s part of my ongoing short fiction review series, I read every freely-available Hugo-winning short story. I rated these based on how much I enjoyed them personally, not on how good they are in general. These all won Hugos, so you're not likely to find a "bad" story.
 
I'll be using a scale from one to five cups of joe, which is exactly like the five-star scale, only tastier.</p>
